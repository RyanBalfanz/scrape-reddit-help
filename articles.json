This check identifies potential community rule violations and surfaces them to the redditor in order to nudge them to alter their post before submission.</p>\n<p>While this feature has been thoroughly evaluated, it is powered by an LLM and may occasionally produce errors or flag content incorrectly. Redditors can still post even if potential rule violations are flagged, and the tool has a built-in feedback mechanism to help us understand when it fails.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/articles/35317229808660\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Learn more about this feature</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JNH7H84XR45K6W64HGTN1A24\">\n<span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #fafafa;\"><br></span>When is this change happening?</h3>\n<p>On March 6, this will be rolled out to a small group of redditors on our iOS and Android mobile app. <br><br></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JNH6MQRRAHA9TE4CQAT61MD2\">\n<br>Poster Eligibility Guide </h2>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JNH7J1BVNQFKRG0JP9YWZRTW\">What’s changing?</h3>\n<p>Poster Eligibility Guide informs redditors when they can’t post until minimum criteria (account age, karma, and verified email) within the community are met.

They are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Improved visibility for removal reasons in mod tools</strong> - To help mods find removal reasons more easily, we’ve updated the <em>Rules</em> interface in mod tools. Since removal reasons are now part of <em>Saved Responses</em>, we’ve added a direct entry point to <em>Saved Responses</em> and updated the <em>Rules</em> description to clarify where removal reasons can be managed.</li>\n<li>\n<strong><em>Mute User</em> from hover card now works as expected</strong> - Mods can once again mute redditors directly from the hover card without errors. Previously, attempting to mute a redditor resulted in a “something went wrong” message. This issue has been resolved, and the mute function now works as expected.</li>\n<li>\n<strong><em>Invited</em> section now visible on Android</strong> - Mods using Android can now view and manage pending moderator invites in the <em>Invited</em> tab under <em>User Management</em> in mod tools. Previously, this section was missing on Android, preventing mods from seeing or deleting invites. This has now been fixed for parity with other platforms.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Monospaced font restored for wiki automod editing</strong> - The automod wiki editor now correctly displays text in a monospaced font, making it easier to format and edit YAML. Previously, the migration to our new desktop interface caused the text area to use a proportional font, which affected readability. This fix ensures only the automod wiki page uses monospaced text for better accuracy when editing configurations.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sorting is fixed -</strong> No more wrestling with <em>Best</em>—your preferred sort order will now actually stick on desktop and mobile. We’ve made sure that changing the sort in a community will persist, so what you choose is what you get. No surprises, no headaches—just the feed you intended.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JNH7KNG7YS6W9R8ZSMCBWZ01\">When is this change happening? </h3>\n<p>These changes are live today. <br><br></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JNH72J4ZF8SYKVE8B6XY5CS7\">\n<br>New onboarding experience for new mods creating communities</h2>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JNH7KTY1H4312RTF51ZAK4N7\">What’s changing?</h3>\n<p>We’ve recently rolled out a revamped onboarding experience for new mods creating new communities. This experience serves as a guide by displaying key tasks for setting up their communities and creating content. Currently, each task links to the designated section in mod tools such as adding a banner, icon, and creating the first three posts. Once all tasks are completed, we’ll surface additional resources to help mods grow and manage their communities. </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JNH7M0EKR8QHDFN02Q0ZCDT1\">When is this change happening?</h3>\n<p>This experience is live on reddit.com (on desktop) and our iOS and Android mobile app.</p>",

Spam is a violation of the <a href=\"https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">User Agreement</a> and <a href=\"https://redditinc.com/policies/reddit-rules\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reddit Rules</a>, punishable by content removal and temporary or permanent banning of the redditor’s account.</p>\n<p>On Reddit, promotional content is not inherently considered to be spam. That said, some communities do have strict policies that disallow any kind of promotional content. Other communities abide by the 10% rule: only 10% of your posting and comment history in the community can be self-promotional in nature, while the other 90% should be helpful, organic content unrelated to your personal interest. It is ultimately up to you and your team to decide what works best for your community.<br><br></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01J1G2XXYRGXWDXW4JQNJBJ36M\">What settings can I use to reduce spam? </h2>\n<p>Reddit has a number of tools that work automatically behind the scenes to prevent spam from entering community discussions.

Please consult our <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">privacy policy</a> for how we collect, use, and share your personal/private information.</p>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD55ZW23X3SFDKYD3HPZ37G\"><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>\n<p>In this public content policy, we want to help you understand what happens when you create, submit, and make content publicly available on the Reddit platform, and how and why Reddit protects and, where appropriate, licenses public content and related data. Reddit has long supported the open internet and protecting user rights. This policy outlines how those values apply to public content in a new AI era. If you have any questions on this policy, please <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy#contact-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ask us</a>.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD5637J2P00S86A0A4CMDCC\"><strong>Reddit is a public platform and so is the content you post on it</strong></h4>\n<p>Most of Reddit’s platform is public and accessible to everyone, even without an account. This is intentional. We believe in the open internet and in keeping Reddit publicly accessible to foster human learning and research, and to ensure Reddit is a place where all people can find community, belonging, and empowerment. As a result, anyone who has access to the internet can see public posts, comments, usernames, profiles, karma scores, upvote/downvote ratios, and related metadata (collectively, “<strong>public content</strong>”).</p>\n<p>You do not need an account to view the Reddit platform or public content contributed by other Redditors. You also do not need to contribute public posts or comments on the Reddit platform to use it. You choose how much (or how little) you want to interact with the Reddit platform and contribute publicly. If you choose to contribute public content on the Reddit platform, you are making that public content available to the general public.  <br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD566MPBT49N7PBPMQXMP1H\">\n<strong>Reddit may provide public content to others, but never private Redditor data</strong> </h4>\n<p>Reddit may share public content on the Reddit platform with others, including moderators, researchers, developers, and other data licensees. But Reddit does not license or make publicly available private data about Redditors, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Private messages, private group chats, mod mail, and deleted posts and comments; </li>\n<li>Non-public account information (e.g., email address, IP address, phone number, etc.);</li>\n<li>Posts and comments in quarantined or private communities; and</li>\n<li>Browsing or purchasing history.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Redditors place great trust in us to respect their private, non-public information, and we take our role as stewards of this information seriously. That’s why we never license private Redditor data, nor do we otherwise share it without your permission unless legally compelled to do so. See our <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">privacy policy</a> for further details. <br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD569WJQ8BWR30HEXNK5QGC\"><strong>Reddit believes in an open internet, but not the misuse of public content</strong></h4>\n<p>One of Reddit’s values is Default Open. We believe that the free flow of ideas and conversation is the lifeblood of a healthy internet. Our terms have always aligned with our Default Open value <span style=\"color: #4d5156; background-color: #ffffff;\">— </span>you can use Reddit content for non-commercial uses, such as learning and community, but talk to us if you have commercial purposes in mind. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we see more and more entities using unauthorized access (for example, by scraping or using data brokers) or misusing authorized access to collect public data in bulk, especially with the rise of use cases like generative AI. These entities amass public data, including Reddit content, for their own commercial gain, with no perceived limits to their use of that data, and with no regard for user rights or privacy. This sort of misuse of public data has become more prominent as more and more platforms close themselves off from the open internet.  </p>\n<p>We still believe in an open internet, but we do not believe that third parties have a right to misuse public content just because it’s public.  <br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD56DK32GJ18FER8QYTQNYY\"><strong>Reddit may license public content for commercial or non-commercial use</strong></h4>\n<p>To address this misuse of public Reddit content, we enter into licensing arrangements that allow us to put into place meaningful protections. The arrangements provide licensees with enterprise-grade performance and access to Reddit public content. This is the same public content that you see on the Reddit platform. </p>\n<p>Data licensing arrangements enable Reddit to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Know who is accessing Reddit public content and why;</li>\n<li>Place contractual restrictions on prohibited use of public content to protect user rights; and</li>\n<li>Ensure data licensees honor public content deletions by Redditors and Reddit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our data licensees are primarily:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Companies that help brands monitor trends associated with their brands;</li>\n<li>Large language model makers that share our values that not all public data on the open internet is free to use without restraint; and</li>\n<li>Researchers trying to better humanity and the open internet, to whom we continue to provide access to Reddit public content for research. </li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD56J3R8M89G63RT3FWB0RH\"><strong>Protecting Redditors in our data licensing arrangements is essential</strong></h4>\n<p>Our data licensing arrangements include strict restrictions – that we will strongly enforce – to protect Redditors and the anonymity and privacy that is core to our platform. Our licensees <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">cannot</span>, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue to use or display public content <a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/sections/360008917951-Deleting-Your-Reddit-Data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deleted</a> by Redditors or Reddit for content policy violations;<em> </em>\n</li>\n<li>Access or display sexually explicit content;  </li>\n<li>Use public content to segment, target, or profile Redditors based on their health, negative financial status or condition, political affiliation or beliefs, sex life or sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical affiliation or beliefs, trade union membership, criminal data, or other legally restricted sensitive personal information;</li>\n<li>Combine third-party data with Reddit public content to target ads to Redditors or build customer data sets without Reddit or Redditor consent; </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Use public content to spam or harass Redditors; </li>\n<li>Track, alert, monitor, or investigate sensitive events (for example, protests or rallies) or sensitive groups or organizations (for example, unions or activist groups) using public content;</li>\n<li>Perform background checks, extreme vetting, credit or risk insurance analyses, individual profiling, psychographic segmentation, or facial recognition using public content;</li>\n<li>Make public content available to the government or other third parties for surveillance, intelligence, or other law enforcement purposes; or</li>\n<li>Use public content for any illegal, deceptive, unethical, false, misleading, or improper purpose, including the infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD571PY1P29JEC641QFZ75N\"><strong>How to make your content non-public</strong></h4>\n<p>Reddit is inherently a public platform. You choose whether you want to create an account, publicly post, or comment on the Reddit platform, and what you include about yourself in any posts or comments you make publicly available. </p>\n<p>If you prefer not to contribute content publicly, you have a number of options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">You can choose to participate in private communities, which are excluded from our data licensing arrangements.</span></li>\n<li>You can delete posts and comments. Deleted posts and comments are no longer publicly displayed on the Reddit platform. We also require licensees in our data licensing arrangements to stop using deleted posts and comments and provide them with compliance<span style=\"color: #1f1f1f; background-color: #ffffff;\"> tools to help automate public content deletions</span>. We cannot guarantee that third parties have deleted copies of Reddit public content they’ve made without your or our permission.

This includes protections against others selling counterfeit goods – inauthentic and unauthorized copies of another brand’s goods – that use the trademark.</p>\n<p>You can read more about trademarks <a href=\"https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/what-trademark\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-right\"><a href=\"#h_01HV3H0N69GNNT091X1YQ1YS0K\">Back to top</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HV3G58D5PAM3TKTFBZ6VVV14\">\n<br>What is Reddit’s Trademark Policy?</h2>\n<p>Reddit respects the intellectual property of others, including trademarks, and expects our users to do the same. Do not make unauthorized use of another’s trademark in a way that may confuse or mislead others about the source of goods or services, or affiliation with the trademark owner.</p>\n<p>Here are a few examples that may be considered Trademark Policy violations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using another’s trademark in a way that may suggest you are affiliated with the trademark owner (when you are not)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent7\">A national bank has a trademark for their logo. A Reddit user creates an image post that uses the bank’s trademarked logo without the bank’s approval, in order to promote the user’s new cryptocurrency.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using another’s trademark to sell, offer, or promote goods or services that are confusingly similar to the trademark owner’s goods or services</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent7\">A jewelry brand has a registered trademark in the United States for their company name. A Reddit user makes a post promoting their own start-up jewelry business using the same name targeting consumers in the United States.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Selling or promoting the sale of counterfeit goods</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent7\">A luxury fashion accessories brand has a trademark for their logo.

In these circumstances, the use of the trademark generally does not violate Reddit’s Trademark Policy. Here are a few examples that are generally not considered to be violations of this policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using a trademark for the purpose of providing reviews, discussion, news reporting, parody, or criticism of the trademark owner’s goods or services</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent7\">A clothing brand has a trademark for their company name. A Reddit user comments in reply to a post about the brand’s return policy. In their comment, they use the trademark to refer to the clothing brand and to share their negative experience dealing with the brand’s customer service team.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using a trademark in a manner that is outside the trademark’s scope of protection, for example to sell or promote goods or services in a different territory or a different type of goods or services than the trademark is registered to protect</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent7\">A company has a registered trademark in the United States for the name of their health supplements. A Reddit user happens to use the same name for their Japan-based band and makes a post promoting their band’s live music performances.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using a trademark in a way that has nothing to do with the trademark owner’s goods or services</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent7\">A brewery has a trademark for the name of their most popular craft beer, the “SouthNorth.” A Reddit user creates the username “u/southnorth” and posts about video games.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using a trademark in a subreddit name to help people understand the community’s purpose, such as discussion about the trademark owner’s products or business practices</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent7\">A company has a trademark for the name of their software. A Reddit user creates a subreddit named after the software, where people can ask questions about how to use the software and share their own solutions to common issues.

      "body": "<h3 id=\"h_01HP0CKKYT3BV8J43XA4XR5XSF\">Recommendations on Reddit</h3>\n<p>Reddit is a vast network of communities that are created, run, and populated by you, Reddit’s users. Through these communities, you can post, comment, vote, discuss, learn, debate, support, and connect with people who share your interests. To help you find your home on Reddit and to personalize your experience, we recommend content and communities that we think you will enjoy. Those recommendations are based on a variety of factors, including information related to the content, such as a post’s vote count and comment history, your activity on the platform, the communities you are subscribed to, and your account settings.<br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HP0CKWPMG649TD533FASQMXR\">How Reddit Recommends Content and Personalizes Your Experience </h3>\n<p>Your feed experience on Reddit depends on how you are accessing the service, including whether you are logged-in or logged-out.  </p>\n<p>The main, default feed on Reddit for logged-in users is the Home feed, which includes content from the communities that you are subscribed to. By default, your Home feed also includes recommendations for content and communities that you may not be subscribed to, and content from your subscribed communities is presented to you in a personalized ordering or ranking. </p>\n<p>Personalized feed recommendations and rankings are based on a number of factors, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Content-related information:</strong> Information about the content we’re considering showing you, including user upvotes and downvotes, the subreddit where the content was posted, the comment history on the post, the post type, post age, and post flairs.  </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Your activity on Reddit:</strong> The content and communities that you have engaged with on your current and past visits to Reddit, your upvotes and downvotes, the time you’ve spent on specific subreddits, the subreddits you’ve visited recently, your subreddit subscriptions, the topics you told us you were interested in when you created your account, and the types of posts you’ve asked us to show less of.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Your account age</strong>: For users with newer accounts or fewer community subscriptions, our models may emphasize recommendations over subscriptions. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Your location setting</strong>: We customize recommendations based on the preference indicated in your <a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/articles/360062429491-Managing-your-Country-Setting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Location Settings</a>.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The process used to ultimately recommend a piece of content involves multiple steps using the factors described above. We first create an initial list of content you might enjoy (i.e., candidate generation). Then we filter out stuff you shouldn't have to deal with, such as spam, content you’ve seen before, or content you’ve blocked. Next, we use predictive models to anticipate what you may or may not like. Finally, we sort content according to those predictions, and to ensure a level of diversity of content in your feeds. For example, we aim to avoid showing you too many similar posts in a row in the feed, to ensure that you get a broad view of the content that Reddit has to offer. The importance of any given factor in this process can change dynamically based on your activity, your engagement with recommended content, and the feedback you provide.</p>\n<p>For logged-out users, the default feed is the <span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Popular feed, which showcases the most popular recent posts on Reddit, as determined by net upvotes. For users in certain countries, we may customize the Popular feed based on your location (using your IP address if you are logged out and, if you are logged-in, using the preference indicated in </span>your <a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/articles/360062429491-Managing-your-Country-Setting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Location Setting</a>). </p>\n<p>We also recommend topics and communities that may be of interest to you – such as via our Communities Tab on the Reddit mobile apps, or our search feature, which highlights trending topics. Communities are recommended based on how active they are both in your location and globally, as well as whether they relate to topics that are currently trending. If you’re logged-in, community recommendations are also based on their similarity to subreddits you’re already subscribed to or have previously interacted with. We determine trends based on popular discussion topics, including in subreddits that are particularly active at a given time.<br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HP0CMR20QTPXMARKKHXPA58R\">Additional Considerations that Impact Content Recommendations </h3>\n<p>We aim to recommend content that is suitable for a general audience, and never want you to get a recommendation for something that is unexpected or doesn’t reflect the best that Reddit has to offer. This means we try to ensure mature content and even content with sensitive themes will not make its way into your recommended content unless you are subscribed to the communities that content originates from or you have otherwise expressed an interest in seeing that type of content.  Even in those cases, recommendations of this type of content may be limited. <br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HP0CN26KT4G12FW51TCHHW06\">How to Influence What You See on Reddit</h3>\n<p>There are a number of ways to influence the content you discover on Reddit, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Feedback Buttons: </strong>When personalizing recommendations for you, we want to know what's working and what's not. For example, on your Home feed, when you see a recommended post, we’ll also tell you why you’re seeing it – whether it’s popular on Reddit right now or because it’s similar to content you’ve interacted with before. If you don't like the recommendation, you can let us know by clicking “show fewer posts like this” on the recommendation bar. Once we receive this feedback, we’ll stop showing you recommendations from the subreddit that the post came from and we’ll try to show you fewer posts from similar subreddits.   </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Personalization Settings: </strong>For logged-in users, if you don’t want to see content recommendations from communities you are not subscribed to in your home feed, you can <a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/articles/4402284777364-What-are-home-feed-recommendations-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">disable home feed recommendations in your account preferences</a>. You can also decide how your location is used to recommend content and personalize your experience via the <a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/articles/360062429491-Managing-your-Country-Setting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Location Setting in your account settings</a>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Home Feed Sorting</strong>: There are other ways to sort your feed on the Reddit web experience: \n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Hot</strong>. This sort prioritizes recent posts that have been getting upvotes. Hot can be used if you’re looking for trending topics.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Top</strong>. This sort prioritizes posts that have all-time high upvote numbers and comments. Top can be filtered by time as well. For example, you may only want Top content from the last week. Use this sort if you’re looking for well known posts. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>New</strong>. This sort prioritizes the newest posts, regardless of upvotes and comments. New is best used if you’re trying to see the most up-to-date information. The Latest feed, available only on Reddit mobile apps, is your subscription content organized by New.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Rising</strong>. This sort prioritizes posts with the most recent views. Rising can be filtered by time as well. For example, you may only want Rising content from last week.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Community and Search Sorting</strong>: Content in each individual Reddit community, as well as <a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/articles/19695706914196-What-filters-and-sorts-are-available\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">search results</a>, also have a variety of similar sorts available. Content on a subreddit page is sorted by “hot” by default, though for logged-in users, you have the option to modify this default in your settings, or to have each community remember and use the last content sort you selected for that community. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Community Muting: </strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">Community muting allows logged-in users to exclude selected communities from showing up in their notifications and certain feeds. For more information about community muting, please visit our </span><a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/articles/9810475384084-What-is-community-muting-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">help center article</a><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">.

What this means and how to best use this information will look different for each community, depending on what tools you’re currently leveraging in your moderation. That said, we’ve included a couple of examples below:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re seeing an influx of rule violation reports on comments in your community, ensure you’re using </span><a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/15484545006996\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Crowd Control</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a way that might reduce the burden on your mod team and on your community. </span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re seeing a high percentage of manual moderator removals due to reports from users, that might be a signal that you need to be using </span><a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/15484574206484-AutoModerator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">automoderator</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to better safeguard your community.<br><br></span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01H8Z421JAXDM0CN81QKCE6CR4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Interpreting Most Active Moderators</strong> </span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This stat can help highlight when a moderator or moderators may be at risk of becoming burnt-out. Much like we mentioned under the section on </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Active moderators vs Recommended minimum active moderators</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, this can signal a need for a team check-in to see how everyone is doing and determine if anyone could use some time away from the mod queues. Volunteering to build and moderate a community generally shows real passion and care for that community’s focus but sometimes that can mean not taking the time you need for yourself while wanting everything to be as excellent and in line with your team’s vision as possible. To gain balance, it might be a good idea to </span><a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/15484067270932-Recruiting-new-moderators\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">add more moderators to the team</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help better distribute the moderation tasks to ensure people feel comfortable stepping away as often as wanted or needed. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01H8Z421JA4PW6E7YF87CXC16G\"><strong>Interpreting Ban Evasion Reporting and Actioning Information</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The data shared in this section is intended to promote transparency around the Safety actions we take on ban evaders participating in your community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you suspect a user is evading a ban in your community, please use the </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/report?reason=its-ban-evasion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">report form for ban evasion</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so we can review the situation and take the appropriate action.

While it’s fine to start your own community even if the theme is similar to others, if an identical community exists that’s already thriving, you may want to consider joining it, being an active participant in the community, and then volunteering or applying to moderate. This can allow your ideas and efforts to have an immediate impact on an established group of subscribers.
