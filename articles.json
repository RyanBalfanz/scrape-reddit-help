Please consult our <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">privacy policy</a> for how we collect, use, and share your personal/private information.</p>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD55ZW23X3SFDKYD3HPZ37G\"><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>\n<p>In this public content policy, we want to help you understand what happens when you create, submit, and make content publicly available on the Reddit platform, and how and why Reddit protects and, where appropriate, licenses public content and related data. Reddit has long supported the open internet and protecting user rights. This policy outlines how those values apply to public content in a new AI era. If you have any questions on this policy, please <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy#contact-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ask us</a>.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD5637J2P00S86A0A4CMDCC\"><strong>Reddit is a public platform and so is the content you post on it</strong></h4>\n<p>Most of Reddit’s platform is public and accessible to everyone, even without an account. This is intentional. We believe in the open internet and in keeping Reddit publicly accessible to foster human learning and research, and to ensure Reddit is a place where all people can find community, belonging, and empowerment. As a result, anyone who has access to the internet can see public posts, comments, usernames, profiles, karma scores, upvote/downvote ratios, and related metadata (collectively, “<strong>public content</strong>”).</p>\n<p>You do not need an account to view the Reddit platform or public content contributed by other Redditors. You also do not need to contribute public posts or comments on the Reddit platform to use it. You choose how much (or how little) you want to interact with the Reddit platform and contribute publicly. If you choose to contribute public content on the Reddit platform, you are making that public content available to the general public.  <br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD566MPBT49N7PBPMQXMP1H\">\n<strong>Reddit may provide public content to others, but never private Redditor data</strong> </h4>\n<p>Reddit may share public content on the Reddit platform with others, including moderators, researchers, developers, and other data licensees. But Reddit does not license or make publicly available private data about Redditors, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Private messages, private group chats, mod mail, and deleted posts and comments; </li>\n<li>Non-public account information (e.g., email address, IP address, phone number, etc.);</li>\n<li>Posts and comments in quarantined or private communities; and</li>\n<li>Browsing or purchasing history.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Redditors place great trust in us to respect their private, non-public information, and we take our role as stewards of this information seriously. That’s why we never license private Redditor data, nor do we otherwise share it without your permission unless legally compelled to do so. See our <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">privacy policy</a> for further details. <br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD569WJQ8BWR30HEXNK5QGC\"><strong>Reddit believes in an open internet, but not the misuse of public content</strong></h4>\n<p>One of Reddit’s values is Default Open. We believe that the free flow of ideas and conversation is the lifeblood of a healthy internet. Our terms have always aligned with our Default Open value <span style=\"color: #4d5156; background-color: #ffffff;\">— </span>you can use Reddit content for non-commercial uses, such as learning and community, but talk to us if you have commercial purposes in mind. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we see more and more entities using unauthorized access (for example, by scraping or using data brokers) or misusing authorized access to collect public data in bulk, especially with the rise of use cases like generative AI. These entities amass public data, including Reddit content, for their own commercial gain, with no perceived limits to their use of that data, and with no regard for user rights or privacy. This sort of misuse of public data has become more prominent as more and more platforms close themselves off from the open internet.  </p>\n<p>We still believe in an open internet, but we do not believe that third parties have a right to misuse public content just because it’s public.  <br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD56DK32GJ18FER8QYTQNYY\"><strong>Reddit may license public content for commercial or non-commercial use</strong></h4>\n<p>To address this misuse of public Reddit content, we enter into licensing arrangements that allow us to put into place meaningful protections. The arrangements provide licensees with enterprise-grade performance and access to Reddit public content. This is the same public content that you see on the Reddit platform. </p>\n<p>Data licensing arrangements enable Reddit to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Know who is accessing Reddit public content and why;</li>\n<li>Place contractual restrictions on prohibited use of public content to protect user rights; and</li>\n<li>Ensure data licensees honor public content deletions by Redditors and Reddit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our data licensees are primarily:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Companies that help brands monitor trends associated with their brands;</li>\n<li>Large language model makers that share our values that not all public data on the open internet is free to use without restraint; and</li>\n<li>Researchers trying to better humanity and the open internet, to whom we continue to provide access to Reddit public content for research. </li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD56J3R8M89G63RT3FWB0RH\"><strong>Protecting Redditors in our data licensing arrangements is essential</strong></h4>\n<p>Our data licensing arrangements include strict restrictions – that we will strongly enforce – to protect Redditors and the anonymity and privacy that is core to our platform. Our licensees <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">cannot</span>, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue to use or display public content <a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/sections/360008917951-Deleting-Your-Reddit-Data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deleted</a> by Redditors or Reddit for content policy violations;<em> </em>\n</li>\n<li>Access or display sexually explicit content;  </li>\n<li>Use public content to segment, target, or profile Redditors based on their health, negative financial status or condition, political affiliation or beliefs, sex life or sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical affiliation or beliefs, trade union membership, criminal data, or other legally restricted sensitive personal information;</li>\n<li>Combine third-party data with Reddit public content to target ads to Redditors or build customer data sets without Reddit or Redditor consent; </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Use public content to spam or harass Redditors; </li>\n<li>Track, alert, monitor, or investigate sensitive events (for example, protests or rallies) or sensitive groups or organizations (for example, unions or activist groups) using public content;</li>\n<li>Perform background checks, extreme vetting, credit or risk insurance analyses, individual profiling, psychographic segmentation, or facial recognition using public content;</li>\n<li>Make public content available to the government or other third parties for surveillance, intelligence, or other law enforcement purposes; or</li>\n<li>Use public content for any illegal, deceptive, unethical, false, misleading, or improper purpose, including the infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD571PY1P29JEC641QFZ75N\"><strong>How to make your content non-public</strong></h4>\n<p>Reddit is inherently a public platform. You choose whether you want to create an account, publicly post, or comment on the Reddit platform, and what you include about yourself in any posts or comments you make publicly available. </p>\n<p>If you prefer not to contribute content publicly, you have a number of options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">You can choose to participate in private communities, which are excluded from our data licensing arrangements.</span></li>\n<li>You can delete posts and comments. Deleted posts and comments are no longer publicly displayed on the Reddit platform. We also require licensees in our data licensing arrangements to stop using deleted posts and comments and provide them with compliance<span style=\"color: #1f1f1f; background-color: #ffffff;\"> tools to help automate public content deletions</span>. We cannot guarantee that third parties have deleted copies of Reddit public content they’ve made without your or our permission.

Do not make unauthorized use of another’s trademark in a way that may confuse or mislead others about the source of goods or services, or affiliation with the trademark owner.</p>\n<p>Here are a few examples that may be considered Trademark Policy violations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using another’s trademark in a way that may suggest you are affiliated with the trademark owner (when you are not)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent7\">A national bank has a trademark for their logo. A Reddit user creates an image post that uses the bank’s trademarked logo without the bank’s approval, in order to promote the user’s new cryptocurrency.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using another’s trademark to sell, offer, or promote goods or services that are confusingly similar to the trademark owner’s goods or services</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent7\">A jewelry brand has a registered trademark in the United States for their company name.

In these circumstances, the use of the trademark generally does not violate Reddit’s Trademark Policy. Here are a few examples that are generally not considered to be violations of this policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using a trademark for the purpose of providing reviews, discussion, news reporting, parody, or criticism of the trademark owner’s goods or services</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent7\">A clothing brand has a trademark for their company name. A Reddit user comments in reply to a post about the brand’s return policy. In their comment, they use the trademark to refer to the clothing brand and to share their negative experience dealing with the brand’s customer service team.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using a trademark in a manner that is outside the trademark’s scope of protection, for example to sell or promote goods or services in a different territory or a different type of goods or services than the trademark is registered to protect</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent7\">A company has a registered trademark in the United States for the name of their health supplements.

      "body": "<h3 id=\"h_01HP0CKKYT3BV8J43XA4XR5XSF\">Recommendations on Reddit</h3>\n<p>Reddit is a vast network of communities that are created, run, and populated by you, Reddit’s users. Through these communities, you can post, comment, vote, discuss, learn, debate, support, and connect with people who share your interests. To help you find your home on Reddit and to personalize your experience, we recommend content and communities that we think you will enjoy. Those recommendations are based on a variety of factors, including information related to the content, such as a post’s vote count and comment history, your activity on the platform, the communities you are subscribed to, and your account settings.<br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HP0CKWPMG649TD533FASQMXR\">How Reddit Recommends Content and Personalizes Your Experience </h3>\n<p>Your feed experience on Reddit depends on how you are accessing the service, including whether you are logged-in or logged-out.  </p>\n<p>The main, default feed on Reddit for logged-in users is the Home feed, which includes content from the communities that you are subscribed to. By default, your Home feed also includes recommendations for content and communities that you may not be subscribed to, and content from your subscribed communities is presented to you in a personalized ordering or ranking. </p>\n<p>Personalized feed recommendations and rankings are based on a number of factors, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Content-related information:</strong> Information about the content we’re considering showing you, including user upvotes and downvotes, the subreddit where the content was posted, the comment history on the post, the post type, post age, and post flairs.  </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Your activity on Reddit:</strong> The content and communities that you have engaged with on your current and past visits to Reddit, your upvotes and downvotes, the time you’ve spent on specific subreddits, the subreddits you’ve visited recently, your subreddit subscriptions, the topics you told us you were interested in when you created your account, and the types of posts you’ve asked us to show less of.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Your account age</strong>: For users with newer accounts or fewer community subscriptions, our models may emphasize recommendations over subscriptions. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Your location customization setting</strong>: We customize recommendations based on the preference indicated in your <a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360062429491-Managing-your-Country-Setting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Location Customization Setting</a>.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The process used to ultimately recommend a piece of content involves multiple steps using the factors described above. We first create an initial list of content you might enjoy (i.e., candidate generation). Then we filter out stuff you shouldn't have to deal with, such as spam, content you’ve seen before, or content you’ve blocked. Next, we use predictive models to anticipate what you may or may not like. Finally, we sort content according to those predictions, and to ensure a level of diversity of content in your feeds. For example, we aim to avoid showing you too many similar posts in a row in the feed, to ensure that you get a broad view of the content that Reddit has to offer. The importance of any given factor in this process can change dynamically based on your activity, your engagement with recommended content, and the feedback you provide.</p>\n<p>For logged-out users, the default feed is the <span style=\"color: #0e101a;\">Popular feed, which showcases the most popular recent posts on Reddit, as determined by net upvotes. For users in certain countries, we may customize the Popular feed based on your location (using your IP address if you are logged out and, if you are logged-in, using the preference indicated in </span>your <a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360062429491-Managing-your-Country-Setting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Location Customization Setting</a>). </p>\n<p>We also recommend topics and communities that may be of interest to you – such as via our Communities Tab on the Reddit mobile apps, or our search feature, which highlights trending topics. Communities are recommended based on how active they are both in your location and globally, as well as whether they relate to topics that are currently trending. If you’re logged-in, community recommendations are also based on their similarity to subreddits you’re already subscribed to or have previously interacted with. We determine trends based on popular discussion topics, including in subreddits that are particularly active at a given time.<br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HP0CMR20QTPXMARKKHXPA58R\">Additional Considerations that Impact Content Recommendations </h3>\n<p>We aim to recommend content that is suitable for a general audience, and never want you to get a recommendation for something that is unexpected or doesn’t reflect the best that Reddit has to offer. This means we try to ensure mature content and even content with sensitive themes will not make its way into your recommended content unless you are subscribed to the communities that content originates from or you have otherwise expressed an interest in seeing that type of content.  Even in those cases, recommendations of this type of content may be limited. <br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HP0CN26KT4G12FW51TCHHW06\">How to Influence What You See on Reddit</h3>\n<p>There are a number of ways to influence the content you discover on Reddit, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Feedback Buttons: </strong>When personalizing recommendations for you, we want to know what's working and what's not. For example, on your Home feed, when you see a recommended post, we’ll also tell you why you’re seeing it – whether it’s popular on Reddit right now or because it’s similar to content you’ve interacted with before. If you don't like the recommendation, you can let us know by clicking “show fewer posts like this” on the recommendation bar. Once we receive this feedback, we’ll stop showing you recommendations from the subreddit that the post came from and we’ll try to show you fewer posts from similar subreddits.   </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Personalization Settings: </strong>For logged-in users, if you don’t want to see content recommendations from communities you are not subscribed to in your home feed, you can <a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402284777364-What-are-home-feed-recommendations-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">disable home feed recommendations in your user settings</a>. You can also decide how your location is used to recommend content and personalize your experience via the <a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360062429491-Managing-your-Country-Setting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Location Customization Setting in your user settings</a>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Home Feed Sorting</strong>: There are other ways to sort your feed on the Reddit web experience: \n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Hot</strong>. This sort prioritizes recent posts that have been getting upvotes. Hot can be used if you’re looking for trending topics.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Top</strong>. This sort prioritizes posts that have all-time high upvote numbers and comments. Top can be filtered by time as well. For example, you may only want Top content from the last week. Use this sort if you’re looking for well known posts. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>New</strong>. This sort prioritizes the newest posts, regardless of upvotes and comments. New is best used if you’re trying to see the most up-to-date information. The Latest feed, available only on Reddit mobile apps, is your subscription content organized by New.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Rising</strong>. This sort prioritizes posts with the most recent views. Rising can be filtered by time as well. For example, you may only want Rising content from last week.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Community and Search Sorting</strong>: Content in each individual Reddit community, as well as <a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/19695706914196-What-filters-and-sorts-are-available\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">search results</a>, also have a variety of similar sorts available. Content on a subreddit page is sorted by “hot” by default, though for logged-in users, you have the option to modify this default in your settings, or to have each community remember and use the last content sort you selected for that community. </li>\n<li>\n<strong>Community Muting: </strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">Community muting allows logged-in users to exclude selected communities from showing up in their notifications and certain feeds. For more information about community muting, please visit our </span><a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/9810475384084-What-is-community-muting-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">help center article</a><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">.

While it’s fine to start your own community even if the theme is similar to others, if an identical community exists that’s already thriving, you may want to consider joining it, being an active participant in the community, and then volunteering or applying to moderate. This can allow your ideas and efforts to have an immediate impact on an established group of subscribers. If you haven’t moderated before, this can also be a great way to gain experience collaborating with a team and understanding what it takes to keep a community running.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find that a similar community already exists but isn't moderated, however, consider putting in a request to reclaim it via </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">r/redditrequest</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you move forward with creating a community similar to one that exists, it can help your community grow if you ensure it is distinctive and offers something a little different to the existing communities on the topic.<br><br></span></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HF5E1DPD3RQ2YXYQSD9QV9KC\" class=\"p1\">Am I willing and able to actively moderate this community?</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s important to be willing to moderate any community you plan on building.

In an AMA, OP (that stands for “Original Poster”) sets the stage – anything from “I’m Barack Obama” to “I’ve been swallowed by a whale;” and allows redditors to ask them anything in the comments. AMA posts are a great way for your community to get up close and personal with people they may not normally have the chance to hear from.</p>\n<p>AMA posts can be serious, silly, or a little bit of both. They should be a positive interactive experience for your community and the participant(s) answering questions - AMAs can increase comments in a community by up to 5% and returning redditors by 8%!    </p>\n<p>Top AMAs have been hosted by actors, producers, politicians, athletes, scientists and other subject matter experts. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/11ia0od/hi_im_keanu_reeves_ama/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Keanu Reeves’ AMA</a> holds the record for most upvotes, Stephen Hawking <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3eret9/science_ama_series_i_am_stephen_hawking/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shared his wisdom</a> in r/science, the Wall Street Journal’s wine columnist hosted<a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/wine/comments/170ogaa/ive_been_writing_about_wine_for_25_years_ask_me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> an AMA in r/wine</a>.</p>\n<p>AMAs aren’t just for celebrities or public figures though.

They are a unique way to foster direct communication and create a relevant experience for your community.</p>\n<p>AMAs are excellent for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fostering engagement in your community with relevant, exclusive access to the guests</li>\n<li>Amplifying the conversation of topics dear to your community across a broad audience  </li>\n<li>Growing your community with relevant users who come in out of curiosity for the AMA</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>The new AMA feature, which is a tab in the Reddit web composer, is currently in a private beta.

      "body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many reasons you may find yourself looking to recruit new mods for your community. If you’re the only mod, you might find that adding more mods to share the load allows you to enjoy your community more. Perhaps you already have a couple of great mods but find that your community’s traffic has gone up sharply. </span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/3f86m5sx4ka11.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Maybe you're all sleeping when things get crazy</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Whatever your reason for wanting to recruit, some experienced mods </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9fvxg8/friday_fundamentals_thread_finding_fun_friends/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shared their own recruiting processes</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which may help you decide where to start. Below, we've put together what we took away from that conversation.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01H8Z7PKZZ5SA36D5JB6E4S5PG\">When to recruit:</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different mod teams have different approaches to this. Some mod teams choose to actively recruit on a regular basis, while others wait until they feel there is a clear need for more moderation in the community. The latter can commonly be triggered by </span><a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/15484261845780\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quick traffic growth</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or busy mods with shifting commitments in their lives. Ultimately, you’ll want to figure out your own process that aligns with your community’s unique needs.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01H8Z7PKZZ1A3D1J5R3HYN29WK\">The recruiting process:</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, a candidate is already active in and familiar with your community and its rules and norms. The approach to actual recruiting can vary and change over time based on a community's needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suggestions and common approaches include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a formal application process</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making an announcement to let the community know you’re looking for new mods</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=ModSupportBot&amp;subject=Mod%20Suggestions&amp;message=Don%27t%20forget%20to%20change%20the%20From%20field%20to%20the%20subreddit%20you%20wish%20to%20query\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Request mod suggestions</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from our automated bot, u/ModSupportBot</span>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reaching out directly to an active community member</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asking established mods you know and trust</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Waiting for community members to reach out and show interest in moderating</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking for volunteers in </span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/needamod/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">r/needamod</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The formal application process and direct outreach were the most commonly cited approaches, which we discuss a little more in-depth below.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01H8Z7PKZZTPNKD1PZGZP4JMH0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Formal Application Process:</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By using an application process, you can elicit answers from potential mods with established questions about things that you know are important to your community. This process may be appealing because it allows you to better understand the interest level of those applying, test their knowledge of the community, and get a feel for how well they might fit in with your community and mod team’s culture. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Often, this process is combined with making an announcement via a </span><a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/15484641176724-Sticky-posts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">stickied post</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to let the community know that you’re recruiting and taking applications.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Applications might be taken through an existing form, announcement comments, messages to the mods, or a variety of other ways that suit your team’s needs.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01H8Z7PM00ZHN4H6YGGWS1WBNA\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Direct Outreach:</span></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you spend a lot of time actively reading or participating in your community, you will probably start to notice that certain community members stand out as being very active, helpful, and knowledgeable. This might make them ideal candidates to help moderate your community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reaching out directly to them can be a good way to get to know their feelings about the current moderation in the community, along with how they might fit in with your mod team and help improve your community.</span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01H8Z7PM00CRDCZ71ZNZB6A6QS\">Tips:</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have an established team of mods, you might consider doing the occasional check-in to see who is still actively interested in moderating, keeping in mind that sometimes life just gets busy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Giving inexperienced mods a chance can sometimes have positive outcomes due to a lack of preconceived notions about what style of moderation is best for your community.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always take a quick look at the posting and commenting history of those you're considering adding as moderators to your community. This can sometimes give you a feel for whether or not they will be a good match.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you mod a globally appealing community that is seeing a lot of growth, sometimes it can be beneficial to recruit people from different time zones.</span></p>"

Moderators in the council are able to beta test tools, preview new or potential features, review upcoming policy changes, and provide direct feedback which informs development. Plus. they can get to know and learn from other moderators in the council. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Admins, meanwhile, receive a more intimate understanding of the variety of needs of moderators so that they may best support the many kinds of communities across the site. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you moderate one or twenty communities, we seek passionate new members who can lend their personal expertise in representing communities covering a diverse range of topics, and community types, including but not limited to; gender, advice, sports, location, fandom, culture, current events, health and lifestyle, language, and gaming. We only ask that you have a sincere desire to make Reddit a better place and are able to articulate your ideas or observations in a constructive manner - we want healthy debates and we have them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The feedback and debates the council has have proved indispensable, and through dialogs with engineers, safety teams, executives, and strategists, we can really build something special for the communities we love, while improving understanding and the relationship between moderators and admins.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HAD2CW627B5CQSVGRD3G8FA4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting Involved</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to the above, to qualify to be a representative in the Reddit Mod Council you must be an active moderator of a community with at least a fair level of activity, be in good standing, and be able to speak on behalf of your team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main point of contact is in our private subreddit where both admins &amp; moderators host discussion threads and participate in voice calls and Reddit Talks (as well as share photos of pets, play games, and the odd special social event.

Bulk exporting of Reddit data will be significantly limited by default, however, and select developers who require broader access to Reddit data may be charged fees to lift those limits.<br><br></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H69EJ3EFY7G7HNV17ASH24KS\"><strong><br>Research</strong></h2>\n<h4 id=\"01H857CM20DCSM4HZXS4D25EFN\"><strong><em>Can I perform research using Reddit developer tools and services?</em></strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #1d1c1d;\">Use for research purposes is OK provided you use it exclusively for academic (i.e. non-commercial) purposes, and don’t redistribute our data or any derivative products or services based on our data (e.g. models trained using Reddit data).<br><br></span></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXCPEAR68YSMW9WZ9CAJMB7E\"><strong><em>How can I get access to Reddit’s Research API? </em></strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #1d1c1d;\">To learn more about how to propose a research topic and access relevant data, please visit <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit4researchers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">r/reddit4researchers</a>.<br><br></span></p>\n<h4 id=\"01H9R8DF48DZAQE5T712C4QGQ7\"><strong><em>Can I publish my research?</em></strong></h4>\n<p><span style=\"color: #1d1c1d;\">You can publish the results of your research, so long as you exclude our data or any derivative products based on our data (e.g. models trained using Reddit data), you credit Reddit, and anonymize information in your published results.

You’ll be asked to provide a verified Stripe address within the Creator Portal and before completing the submission process for your Collectible Avatar. You should receive your primary sales earnings in your Stripe account within 30 days after a month’s close if you’ve earned more than $50. For example, you should receive March earnings by April 30th.</p>\n<p>Note: For non-US creators, there will be a delay of 5-7 days. <br><br></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HBDHH9C1WKF4BKP6TADZT7N7\">\n<br>Fees</h2>\n<p><strong>Reddit Fees</strong></p>\n<p>Reddit charges a total fee of 20% as compensation for providing the services to you, as well as to support the Collectible Avatars Creator Program.  </p>\n<p><strong>Payment Processing Fees</strong></p>\n<p>Payment processors also charge transaction fees for each Collectible Avatar sale, and those fees can vary greatly depending on whether Collectible Avatars are purchased from Reddit mobile apps or our website (i.e., 30% from Apple and Google, compared to ~2.9% from Stripe).<br><br></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HBDHH9C1P3CKSH03BQY1DHT9\">\n<br>Royalties</h2>\n<p>When your Collectible Avatars are sold on NFT marketplaces that honor royalties (e.g., OpenSea), buyers must pay a 5% royalty fee. You are entitled to 50% of the 5% royalty fee (2.5%), and Reddit is entitled to the remaining 50%. (Not all NFT marketplaces honor royalty fees though, and Reddit cannot collect royalty fees from NFT marketplaces on your behalf.) </p>\n<p>Before we continue, here are a few things you should know: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Series Smart Contract</strong> - This is your smart contract for your Collectible Avatars. When people buy from your series, the Collectible Avatars will mint from this smart contract.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Secondary Contract</strong> - This “splitter” smart contract collects your royalties and periodically pushes withdrawals of your royalties into your creator wallet.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Creator Wallet</strong> - This is the <a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/14134708160916-Web3-Safety-101#h_01GZFSPN90ZKFW8XDV4X11Z01E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wallet</a> you provide us and where your royalty earnings are deposited after withdrawals. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>As part of our services, Reddit will help with configuring the series smart contract and secondary contract, but we don’t own the series smart contract, secondary contract, or creator wallet. This is all owned by you. </p>\n<p>In order to support royalties from secondary sales, Reddit must include a single royalty address on your series smart contract. We use your secondary contract as that address. Then, to make collecting royalties from secondary sales easier, your secondary contract is configured to automatically collect royalties from secondary sales and periodically push withdrawals of royalties to your creator wallet and Reddit’s wallet. Your secondary contract will push withdrawals on the last day of each month but will only push withdrawals if the current royalty balance in your secondary contract exceeds 20 MATIC or 0.01 ETH. </p>\n<p>If you don’t want to wait for your secondary contract’s monthly push withdrawal, then you can trigger a withdrawal on your own by following these instructions:<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HBDHH9C1WVKHZRAZGC9WBB96\"><strong>Manually Withdraw Royalties</strong></h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Find your series smart contract address and view it on polygonscan.com.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">You can find this on OpenSea (click the polygon icon </span><em style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">View on polygonscan</em><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\"> button).</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Find your secondary contract from the series smart contract and view it on polygonscan.com.\n<ul>\n<li>On the page for your series smart contract, select the <em>Contract</em> tab and then click the <em>Read as Proxy</em> button to read your series smart contract.</li>\n<li>Find <em>9.
