See <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/CollectibleAvatars/comments/1n2lajo/closing_up_the_shop/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">our announcement</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>We'll be removing the Vault feature from the Reddit app. You have until January 1, 2026.</strong> Vault is Reddit’s blockchain wallet for storing and managing blockchain goods, including your Collectible Avatar NFTs. You will no longer be able to use the Reddit app to access, recover or use your Vault after that time.</p>\n<p><strong>You'll need to export your Vault to a third-party wallet app or service. </strong>If not, you'll be unable to transfer or sell your Collectible Avatars off-platform, and otherwise unable to access your Vault’s underlying blockchain wallet for any purpose. However, you <em>will</em> continue to be able to use your Collectible Avatars within the app, and be able to claim Collectible Avatars you have received or purchased off-platform.<br><br></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01K3MAY8N0MP6G2K6ZX02T7RZN\"><strong>How do I export my Vault?</strong></h2>\n<p>Reddit Vault manages the blockchain wallet, also called a “crypto wallet”, that holds your Collectible Avatar NFTs. The blockchain is what keeps track of who owns the Collectible Avatars and thus it’s important for you to maintain access to it if you ever want to transfer or sell your Collectible Avatars in the future.</p>\n<p>With Reddit Vault going away, you’ll need to access the blockchain wallet in a compatible wallet app outside of Reddit. To do this, you’ll need to get your Vault’s secret recovery phrase and enter it into a compatible wallet app:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Step 1: </strong><a href=\"#h_01K3MB67BZ5VH24ZXSX7BS9RTH\">Get your Vault's recovery phrase</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Step 2:</strong><a href=\"#h_01K3MBQEKM7NQSK4X6PDCV6WXH\"> Import your wallet into another app using the recovery phrase </a><br><br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01K3MB67BZ5VH24ZXSX7BS9RTH\">Step 1: Get your Vault’s recovery phrase</h2>\n<p>All wallet apps that support Collectible Avatars use the same 12-word <strong>recovery phrase</strong> to access your wallet. This phrase acts like a key to access your wallet using any compatible wallet app, at any time, even after Vault is no longer supported.</p>\n<p>Your Vault’s 12-word recovery phrase is available within Vault settings. Follow these instructions to access it and save it to a safe location.</p>\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<p><em>Important</em>: Like any key or password, make sure to keep this phrase in a safe place and never give it to anyone else. If they get access to the phrase, they may be able to steal your Collectible Avatars. Reddit employees will <em>never</em> ask you for your recovery phrase.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"accordion accordion--default\">\n<div class=\"accordion__item\">\n<div class=\"accordion__item-title\"><strong>On iOS and Android (more secure)</strong></div>\n<div class=\"accordion__item-content\">\n<ol>\n<li>Tap on your avatar to open up the profile menu.</li>\n<li>Tap <em>Vault.</em>\n</li>\n<li>Follow the instructions to recover your Vault, if prompted.\n<ul>\n<li>The steps here depend on how you backed up your Vault when you created it.

You should conduct your own research prior to installing any app.</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong><em>Import</em></strong><strong> or use an </strong><strong><em>existing</em></strong><strong> wallet by entering your </strong><strong><em>recovery phrase</em></strong>. The exact steps vary depending on the app you’ve chosen.\n<ul>\n<li>You’ll need to enter or paste the exact 12 word phrase and it will register that wallet in the app.</li>\n<li>Select the <em>Polygon</em> blockchain network.</li>\n<li>You can verify the wallet was imported by comparing the wallet’s address (0x….) with the address that shows at the top of Vault settings or on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/web/vault\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.reddit.com/web/vault</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>To <strong>view your NFTs</strong> you may need to do one of the following, depending on the app:\n<ul>\n<li>Tap an <em>NFT</em> tab, <em>or</em>\n</li>\n<li>Open an in-app browser, navigate to an NFT marketplace and sign-in using your wallet app, <em>or</em>\n</li>\n<li>Manually <em>import NFTs</em> by providing the <em>contract address</em> and <em>token id</em>. You can find these by tapping your Collectible Avatar in Vault (or in the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/avatar/edit?tab=Outfits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">avatar builder</a> and then tapping <em>View Details</em>), tapping <em>View on Explorer</em>, and then looking for <em>TOKEN CONTRACT</em> and <em>TOKENID</em>, respectively.\n<div class=\"callout callout--warning\">\n<ul>\n<li>Be <em>c</em>areful to not mix up the “#” number with the token id. The “#” number is often 1 higher than the token id. For example, your avatar may be named “Snoo #38” but have a token id of 37.</li>\n<li>Note: If you import your wallet but have difficulty seeing your Collectible Avatars NFTs, try switching to a different wallet app that better supports Polygon NFTs.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you can see your Collectible Avatars in another app, you’ve successfully imported your Vault’s wallet into an outside app! Please remember to keep your 12-word recovery phrase in a safe place and do not share it with anyone.</p>\n<p>If you have multiple Vaults with Collectible Avatars, you’ll need to repeat this process for each Vault address.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To switch to a different Vault on mobile, go to <em>Vault</em>, tap the settings icon (<img src=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/article_attachments/40642834879252\" alt=\"40c762fa-e4f6-4efc-aa59-2b10dde51372\">), and then <em>Sign Out</em>. Then proceed with the steps above, selecting a different Vault to export.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"h_01K3MD14EKBAQ5BQG3SPJRXJVG\">\n<br>I’m having issues recovering my Vault</h2>\n<p>First, make sure that you have updated your Reddit app to the latest version and try again. If that doesn’t resolve your issue, check the following sections:<br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01K3MD14EKM3KEY3DSASXYQRMY\">I’ve lost my Vault password / backup</h3>\n<p>Vault was designed to keep your wallet’s recovery phrase safe so that even Reddit can’t access it. When you created your Vault, you were encouraged to back up that recovery phrase in one of three ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Vault password, a different password from your Reddit account password,</li>\n<li>Cloud recovery, storing a “Reddit” folder in iCloud or Google Drive, or</li>\n<li>Manual backup where you directly copied or wrote down the 12-word recovery phrase.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you lost, forgot, or never secured your Vault in one of the three ways above, <strong>Reddit </strong><strong><em>cannot</em></strong><strong> help you recover your Vault</strong>. We recommend double-checking your password manager as well as your iCloud or Google Drive for backups.<br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01K3MD14EK38XY33H50XE2F1KC\"><em>Create Your Vault</em></h3>\n<p>If you see <em>Create Your Vault</em> when opening Vault on mobile, we have no record of this account ever having a Vault. Your Vault is likely on a different Reddit account.<br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01K3MD14EMDN4MPTRQXYBQCC0N\"><em>Use Recovery Phrase</em></h3>\n<p>If you backed up your Vault using <strong>manual backup</strong>, you should already have your 12-word recovery phrase copied somewhere safe. You can use that recovery phrase in a third-party wallet app as-is.</p>\n<p>If you used <strong>cloud backup</strong>, make sure that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You are on the <em>same kind of device</em> you used to create a Vault, e.g. on Android if you created your vault on Android. You stored a backup file in iCloud or Google Drive and it’s easiest to access that from a similar device. If you changed devices, see the <a href=\"#h_01K3MD14EME6RR2JBPH13TEK72\">instructions below</a>.</li>\n<li>Your Reddit app is accessing the <em>correct cloud account</em>, i.e. the correct Apple account for iCloud or the correct Google account for Android. You can check by making sure the “Reddit” folder appears in your corresponding iCloud or Google Drive.<br><br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01K3MD14EME6RR2JBPH13TEK72\">I used cloud backup but swapped between iOS and Android, or vice versa</h3>\n<p>If you backed up your Vault using <strong>cloud backup</strong>, to Google Drive on Android or iCloud on iOS, it’s easiest to recover your Vault on the same kind of device (e.g. on Android if you backed up on Android).</p>\n<p>However, if you switched from iOS to Android, or vice versa, and no longer have access to an equivalent device, you can still recover your Vault using the following steps:</p>\n<div class=\"accordion accordion--default\">\n<div class=\"accordion__item\">\n<div class=\"accordion__item-title\"><strong>Moved from iOS to Android</strong></div>\n<div class=\"accordion__item-content\">\n<ol>\n<li>Find your Vault cloud backup file.\n<ol>\n<li>Open iCloud. </li>\n<li>Open the “Reddit’ folder and then the “Vault Backups” folder inside.</li>\n<li>Find the file with a name that matches your Vault’s address, e.g. “0x…..redditvault”.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Download the file and then tap to open it using the Reddit app.</li>\n<li>Recovery should happen automatically.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"accordion__item\">\n<div class=\"accordion__item-title\"><strong>Moved from Android to iOS</strong></div>\n<div class=\"accordion__item-content\">\n<ol>\n<li>Find your Vault cloud backup file.\n<ol>\n<li>Open Google Drive.</li>\n<li>Open the “Reddit’ folder and then the “Vault Backups” folder inside.</li>\n<li>Find the file with a name that matches your Vault’s address, e.g. “0x…..redditvault”.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Copy your backup file to iCloud.\n<ol>\n<li>Download the file and reupload it to iCloud.</li>\n<li>The file must end up in the same location, i.e. “Reddit” -&gt; “Vault Backups”.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Open Vault in your Reddit iOS app.\n<ol>\n<li>Open the Reddit App.</li>\n<li>Tap on your profile photo.</li>\n<li>Tap Vault.</li>\n<li>Proceed with the recovery process for your Vault.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"callout callout--info\">\n<p>If you get an error during this process, please try again. It may have succeeded even with the error, or may work the second time.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01K3MDM51NAQRFE68WMK9ZYE40\">\n<strong><em><br></em></strong><em>We hit a snag…</em>\n</h3>\n<p><strong>Make sure you are logged into the correct Reddit account</strong> and are recovering a Vault that matches that account. Vaults can only ever be used with one Reddit account.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you’re attempting to open a cloud backup file using the Reddit Android app, make sure you’re  logged into the correct Reddit account first before tapping the backup file.</li>\n<li>If you’re attempting to enter a 12 word recovery phrase into the Reddit app, make sure you’re logged into the correct account. You cannot use a recovery phrase to open a Vault under a different account.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Make sure your device has the correct time and time zone</strong>. If the time set on your device is incorrect by over 10 minutes, recovery may be rejected.<br><br></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01K3MDM51NM4XRRC2JWG2RB5HB\">Personal address detected</h3>\n<p>Double check that you’ve selected the <strong>Polygon Mainnet Network</strong> in your wallet app, not another network such as the Ethereum Mainnet Network.</p>",

Its goal is to help mod teams up-level key moderation practices, address specific challenges, and build a stronger foundation by facilitating knowledge transfer and best practices.<br><br></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JTGV1EAZDN63D4R7S3788K6S\">Who are Mod Mentors?</h2>\n<p>Mod Mentors are highly experienced moderators of the largest communities on Reddit who volunteer their time and expertise. They work alongside a community's existing mod team, offering guidance and helping implement strategies for specific areas, such as improving moderator recruitment. They temporarily join a mod team to better understand needs and collaborate on solutions.<br><br></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JTGV1GZPPCVP8THKW058W0TT\">How can my mod team request help from a Mod Mentor?</h2>\n<p>We're opening up this opportunity to a small number of targeted communities during the pilot phase. As we grow the program, we will share more broadly how to get involved. <br><br></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JTGV1SY4WGDGGMGT9EZABFKX\">How long can my team expect help from a Mod Mentor?</h2>\n<p>Mentorship through the Mod Mentors program is time-bound and goal-oriented. Unlike emergency support through Mod Reserves, it's focused on achieving a specific outcome, such as onboarding new moderators. The duration depends on the specific goal, but it is designed to be focused support for a defined period, not ongoing assistance.<br><br></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JTGV1YEYKJM2H118SQQ1Z5H5\">How can I become a Mod Mentor?</h2>\n<p>We're currently not recruiting for additional mentors, but will open it up as the program grows. Thank you for your interest! </p>",

This check identifies potential community rule violations and surfaces them to the redditor in order to nudge them to alter their post before submission.</p>\n<p>While this feature has been thoroughly evaluated, it is powered by an LLM and may occasionally produce errors or flag content incorrectly. Redditors can still post even if potential rule violations are flagged, and the tool has a built-in feedback mechanism to help us understand when it fails.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/articles/35317229808660\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Learn more about this feature</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JNH7H84XR45K6W64HGTN1A24\">\n<span style=\"color: #222222; background-color: #fafafa;\"><br></span>When is this change happening?</h3>\n<p>On March 6, this will be rolled out to a small group of redditors on our iOS and Android mobile app. <br><br></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JNH6MQRRAHA9TE4CQAT61MD2\">\n<br>Poster Eligibility Guide </h2>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JNH7J1BVNQFKRG0JP9YWZRTW\">What’s changing?</h3>\n<p>Poster Eligibility Guide informs redditors when they can’t post until minimum criteria (account age, karma, and verified email) within the community are met.

They are: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Improved visibility for removal reasons in mod tools</strong> - To help mods find removal reasons more easily, we’ve updated the <em>Rules</em> interface in mod tools. Since removal reasons are now part of <em>Saved Responses</em>, we’ve added a direct entry point to <em>Saved Responses</em> and updated the <em>Rules</em> description to clarify where removal reasons can be managed.</li>\n<li>\n<strong><em>Mute User</em> from hover card now works as expected</strong> - Mods can once again mute redditors directly from the hover card without errors. Previously, attempting to mute a redditor resulted in a “something went wrong” message. This issue has been resolved, and the mute function now works as expected.</li>\n<li>\n<strong><em>Invited</em> section now visible on Android</strong> - Mods using Android can now view and manage pending moderator invites in the <em>Invited</em> tab under <em>User Management</em> in mod tools. Previously, this section was missing on Android, preventing mods from seeing or deleting invites. This has now been fixed for parity with other platforms.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Monospaced font restored for wiki automod editing</strong> - The automod wiki editor now correctly displays text in a monospaced font, making it easier to format and edit YAML. Previously, the migration to our new desktop interface caused the text area to use a proportional font, which affected readability. This fix ensures only the automod wiki page uses monospaced text for better accuracy when editing configurations.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sorting is fixed -</strong> No more wrestling with <em>Best</em>—your preferred sort order will now actually stick on desktop and mobile. We’ve made sure that changing the sort in a community will persist, so what you choose is what you get. No surprises, no headaches—just the feed you intended.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JNH7KNG7YS6W9R8ZSMCBWZ01\">When is this change happening? </h3>\n<p>These changes are live today. <br><br></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"h_01JNH72J4ZF8SYKVE8B6XY5CS7\">\n<br>New onboarding experience for new mods creating communities</h2>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JNH7KTY1H4312RTF51ZAK4N7\">What’s changing?</h3>\n<p>We’ve recently rolled out a revamped onboarding experience for new mods creating new communities. This experience serves as a guide by displaying key tasks for setting up their communities and creating content. Currently, each task links to the designated section in mod tools such as adding a banner, icon, and creating the first three posts. Once all tasks are completed, we’ll surface additional resources to help mods grow and manage their communities. </p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01JNH7M0EKR8QHDFN02Q0ZCDT1\">When is this change happening?</h3>\n<p>This experience is live on reddit.com (on desktop) and our iOS and Android mobile app.</p>",

Reddit has long supported the open internet and protecting user rights. This policy outlines how those values apply to public content in a new AI era. If you have any questions on this policy, please <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy#contact-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ask us</a>.<br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD5637J2P00S86A0A4CMDCC\"><strong>Reddit is a public platform and so is the content you post on it</strong></h4>\n<p>Most of Reddit’s platform is public and accessible to everyone, even without an account. This is intentional. We believe in the open internet and in keeping Reddit publicly accessible to foster human learning and research, and to ensure Reddit is a place where all people can find community, belonging, and empowerment. As a result, anyone who has access to the internet can see public posts, comments, usernames, profiles, karma scores, and related metadata (collectively, “<strong>public content</strong>”).</p>\n<p>You do not need an account to view the Reddit platform or public content contributed by other Redditors. You also do not need to contribute public posts or comments on the Reddit platform to use it. You choose how much (or how little) you want to interact with the Reddit platform and contribute publicly. If you choose to contribute public content on the Reddit platform, you are making that public content available to the general public.  <br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD566MPBT49N7PBPMQXMP1H\">\n<strong>Reddit may provide public content to others, but never private Redditor data</strong> </h4>\n<p>Reddit may share public content on the Reddit platform with others, including moderators, researchers, developers, and other data licensees. But Reddit does not license or make publicly available private data about Redditors, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Private messages, private group chats, mod mail, and deleted posts and comments; </li>\n<li>Non-public account information (e.g., email address, IP address, phone number, etc.);</li>\n<li>Posts and comments in quarantined or private communities; and</li>\n<li>Browsing or purchasing history.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Redditors place great trust in us to respect their private, non-public information, and we take our role as stewards of this information seriously. That’s why we never license private Redditor data, nor do we otherwise share it without your permission unless legally compelled to do so. See our <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">privacy policy</a> for further details. <br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD569WJQ8BWR30HEXNK5QGC\"><strong>Reddit believes in an open internet, but not the misuse of public content</strong></h4>\n<p>One of Reddit’s values is Default Open. We believe that the free flow of ideas and conversation is the lifeblood of a healthy internet. Our terms have always aligned with our Default Open value <span style=\"color: #4d5156; background-color: #ffffff;\">— </span>you can use Reddit content for non-commercial uses, such as learning and community, but talk to us if you have commercial purposes in mind. </p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we see more and more entities using unauthorized access (for example, by scraping or using data brokers) or misusing authorized access to collect public data in bulk, especially with the rise of use cases like generative AI. These entities amass public data, including Reddit content, for their own commercial gain, with no perceived limits to their use of that data, and with no regard for user rights or privacy. This sort of misuse of public data has become more prominent as more and more platforms close themselves off from the open internet.  </p>\n<p>We still believe in an open internet, but we do not believe that third parties have a right to misuse public content just because it’s public.  <br><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD56DK32GJ18FER8QYTQNYY\"><strong>Reddit may license public content for commercial or non-commercial use</strong></h4>\n<p>To address this misuse of public Reddit content, we enter into licensing arrangements that allow us to put into place meaningful protections. The arrangements provide licensees with enterprise-grade performance and access to Reddit public content. This is the same public content that you see on the Reddit platform. </p>\n<p>Data licensing arrangements enable Reddit to: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Know who is accessing Reddit public content and why;</li>\n<li>Place contractual restrictions on prohibited use of public content to protect user rights; and</li>\n<li>Ensure data licensees honor public content deletions by Redditors and Reddit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our data licensees are primarily:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Companies that help brands monitor trends associated with their brands;</li>\n<li>Large language model makers that share our values that not all public data on the open internet is free to use without restraint; and</li>\n<li>Researchers trying to better humanity and the open internet, to whom we continue to provide access to Reddit public content for research. </li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD56J3R8M89G63RT3FWB0RH\"><strong>Protecting Redditors in our data licensing arrangements is essential</strong></h4>\n<p>Our data licensing arrangements include strict restrictions – that we will strongly enforce – to protect Redditors and the anonymity and privacy that is core to our platform. Our licensees <span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">cannot</span>, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Continue to use or display public content <a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/sections/360008917951-Deleting-Your-Reddit-Data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deleted</a> by Redditors or Reddit for content policy violations;<em> </em>\n</li>\n<li>Access or display sexually explicit content;  </li>\n<li>Use public content to segment, target, or profile Redditors based on their health, negative financial status or condition, political affiliation or beliefs, sex life or sexual orientation, racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical affiliation or beliefs, trade union membership, criminal data, or other legally restricted sensitive personal information;</li>\n<li>Combine third-party data with Reddit public content to target ads to Redditors or build customer data sets without Reddit or Redditor consent; </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Use public content to spam or harass Redditors; </li>\n<li>Track, alert, monitor, or investigate sensitive events (for example, protests or rallies) or sensitive groups or organizations (for example, unions or activist groups) using public content;</li>\n<li>Perform background checks, extreme vetting, credit or risk insurance analyses, individual profiling, psychographic segmentation, or facial recognition using public content;</li>\n<li>Make public content available to the government or other third parties for surveillance, intelligence, or other law enforcement purposes; or</li>\n<li>Use public content for any illegal, deceptive, unethical, false, misleading, or improper purpose, including the infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<h4 id=\"h_01HXD571PY1P29JEC641QFZ75N\"><strong>How to make your content non-public</strong></h4>\n<p>Reddit is inherently a public platform. You choose whether you want to create an account, publicly post, or comment on the Reddit platform, and what you include about yourself in any posts or comments you make publicly available. </p>\n<p>If you prefer not to contribute content publicly, you have a number of options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\">You can choose to participate in private communities, which are excluded from our data licensing arrangements.</span></li>\n<li>You can delete posts and comments. Deleted posts and comments are no longer publicly displayed on the Reddit platform. We also require licensees in our data licensing arrangements to stop using deleted posts and comments and provide them with compliance<span style=\"color: #1f1f1f; background-color: #ffffff;\"> tools to help automate public content deletions</span>.

This includes protections against others selling counterfeit goods – inauthentic and unauthorized copies of another brand’s goods – that use the trademark.</p>\n<p>You can read more about trademarks <a href=\"https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/basics/what-trademark\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-right\"><a href=\"#h_01HV3H0N69GNNT091X1YQ1YS0K\">Back to top</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HV3G58D5PAM3TKTFBZ6VVV14\">\n<br>What is Reddit’s Trademark Policy?</h2>\n<p>Reddit respects the intellectual property of others, including trademarks, and expects our users to do the same. Do not make unauthorized use of another’s trademark in a way that may confuse or mislead others about the source of goods or services, or affiliation with the trademark owner.</p>\n<p>Here are a few examples that may be considered Trademark Policy violations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using another’s trademark in a way that may suggest you are affiliated with the trademark owner (when you are not)</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent7\">A national bank has a trademark for their logo. A Reddit user creates an image post that uses the bank’s trademarked logo without the bank’s approval, in order to promote the user’s new cryptocurrency.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using another’s trademark to sell, offer, or promote goods or services that are confusingly similar to the trademark owner’s goods or services</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent7\">A jewelry brand has a registered trademark in the United States for their company name. A Reddit user makes a post promoting their own start-up jewelry business using the same name targeting consumers in the United States.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Selling or promoting the sale of counterfeit goods</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent7\">A luxury fashion accessories brand has a trademark for their logo. A Reddit user makes a post offering counterfeit purses for sale that copy the luxury brand’s trademarked logo and design.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-right\"><a href=\"#h_01HV3H0N69GNNT091X1YQ1YS0K\">Back to top</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HV3G5F9W325CNY4HRBTZCSSC\">\n<br>What is not a Reddit Trademark Policy violation?</h2>\n<p>There are a variety of circumstances where use of a trademark does not confuse or mislead others about the source of goods or services or affiliation with the trademark owner. In these circumstances, the use of the trademark generally does not violate Reddit’s Trademark Policy. Here are a few examples that are generally not considered to be violations of this policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using a trademark for the purpose of providing reviews, discussion, news reporting, parody, or criticism of the trademark owner’s goods or services</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent7\">A clothing brand has a trademark for their company name. A Reddit user comments in reply to a post about the brand’s return policy. In their comment, they use the trademark to refer to the clothing brand and to share their negative experience dealing with the brand’s customer service team.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using a trademark in a manner that is outside the trademark’s scope of protection, for example to sell or promote goods or services in a different territory or a different type of goods or services than the trademark is registered to protect</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent7\">A company has a registered trademark in the United States for the name of their health supplements. A Reddit user happens to use the same name for their Japan-based band and makes a post promoting their band’s live music performances.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using a trademark in a way that has nothing to do with the trademark owner’s goods or services</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent7\">A brewery has a trademark for the name of their most popular craft beer, the “SouthNorth.” A Reddit user creates the username “u/southnorth” and posts about video games.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using a trademark in a subreddit name to help people understand the community’s purpose, such as discussion about the trademark owner’s products or business practices</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-indent7\">A company has a trademark for the name of their software. A Reddit user creates a subreddit named after the software, where people can ask questions about how to use the software and share their own solutions to common issues. The subreddit makes clear that they are not an official company subreddit.</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-right\"><a href=\"#h_01HV3H0N69GNNT091X1YQ1YS0K\">Back to top</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HV3GCA3XAR5JVR5VBRTPQ797\">\n<br>How can trademark owners report Trademark Policy violations to Reddit?</h2>\n<p>If you are a trademark owner or their authorized representative, please use <a href=\"https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=106573\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this form</a> to report potential Trademark Policy violations, including transactions of alleged counterfeit goods.
